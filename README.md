development configuration while the other one is used for in memory. 

middleware via DI - Middleware like Swagger takes in the objects created by the developer and adds different
features(eg -adds UI). Niddleware simplifies our code by creating libraries for the developer so that
they can be used to save time...

NUnit test is done to check the accuracy of our code agianst range of different attributes

When Middleware libraries are used, we do not have to worry about the errors in those libraries. Hence making
our code more accurate
